# HumanitarianDataRegistry
Curation for Humanitarian GIS and Visualizations made possible by USAID in coordination with United Nations Environment CMB and the IMWG GIS Sub Group.  

Registry listings of GIS applications, visualizations and resources including [mapx](https://app.mapx.org/), [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and more than 600 others are registered in this [list](https://github.com/UGA-ITOSHumanitarianGIS/HumanitarianDataRegistry/blob/master/Data/GIS%20Data%20Repositories.xlsx).. 

GIS data for humanitarian purposes may be found on many of these listings through export means. [The Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org) platform serves humanitarian data processes as well with source data. The curation listings categorize these resources by capability and sector. Contact gist@itos.uga.edu for your listing as well as comments. Thank you!
